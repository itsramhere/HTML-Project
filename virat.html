        <h1> Virat Kohli's otherworldly performances in the year of 2023</h1>
        <p>
            For every Virat Kohli fan, 2023 is a bittersweet year. It started off with amazing performances
            in bilateral ODI series in January, then he kept it up with decent performances in the ODI
            series against Australia in March.

            </figure>
            
            <br> The real form kicked off with the 2023 IPL, where the King
            resumed business as usual and scored a whopping 600+ runs, second in the leaderboard for the 
            Orange Cap. <br> Then came the West Indies test series, where he scored a century and missed out on
            a century in another innings. This was in late July. <br> Then came the World Cup, where he was in God-like form. Never
            before had ODI batting been taken to such a level, when he demonstrated his skills on the biggest
            stage and saved his team from the narrow jaws of defeat time after time. <br> Lastly, the South Africa
            Test Series came, where he played like a lone warrior, saving India from embarrassment constantly.
