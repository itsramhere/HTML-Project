            Hello! I am really glad that you have taken time out of your day to 
            view my HTML project. I hope that you will not be disappointed by the time 
            you're doing viewing and/or inspecting it.

        <h2> My basic plan for this page:</h2>
        <p>
            This is a completely different page as you might have guessed. It is linked to my original
            page, making it accessible with just a click. I plan to show you 2 tables:
            one with his results in grandslams and masters 1000s, and if lost - to whom did he lose.
            I have also put in a description list that tells you what a grandslam is and what a masters
            1000 is.
