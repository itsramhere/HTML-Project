        </h1>
        <p> 
            Hello everyone! My name is V. V. Ramarathinam Iyer. This is my HTML project. I have taken 3 
            sportspeople 
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Novak Djokovic</li>
                <li> Elena Rybakina</li>
                <li> Virat Kohli</li>
            </ul>
        <p>

            
            I like all of them, and the order of my liking is not defined, hence the reason for using
            an unordered list above! 
            I have made an effort to compile some data about their 2023 season <em>in brief. </em>
             <br>
            In the end, there is a small questionnaire which I request you to fill so that I get
            to know you better.
            <br>
            Thank you!
            <br>
            </p>
